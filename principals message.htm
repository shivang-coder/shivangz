    <body>Principal Speaks…..

        “What is life if it is not lived for others”. With these simple words and thoughts I addressed my teachers and students on 16th January, 2016 as I took over the charge of St. Francis’ College from Rev. Fr. Denis Naresh Lobo. God has created us for some purpose. The strength of the tree is mainly based on roots. Deeper the roots stronger is the tree. Stronger the tree more the branches, more the branches plenty of fruits. Every student of St. Francis’ College is ‘Good seed sown in a fertile ground’ to come alive, grow and bear good fruits in good time. We need to be fruitful and bring sweetness in others life. In order to be fruitful it is essential to have quality education in one’s life which satisfies mind, heart and soul. Very often education reaches only to the head but not reaches to the heart. Thus, in the society we have plenty of problems.
        
        Schools have to be viewed as the lighthouse of society. It is a reflection of society. We must agree that fundamental changes can come in the society through education only. School is the formation ground where a nation builds its people and shapes its ideologies. In fact, the Quality of education in our schools shall determine the Quality of our world tomorrow. Destiny of a man is shaped in the classroom. School is a building with four walls and tomorrow inside it. Education is a vehicle for social transformation. Besides academic excellence St. Francis’ College has taken the moral responsibility to provide an atmosphere for spiritual, mental and physical growth of the children. The quality education releases capacities, develop analytical abilities, confidence in oneself, will power and goal setting competencies and instils the vision that will enable the child to serve the best interests of the humanity. Let our students become good seed sown in a fertile ground of St. Francis’ College to bear good fruits in good time……….
        
        I am confident that St. Francis’ College, will always be a beacon of light guiding the destiny of its students, while radiating kindness and compassion as it soars high in its pursuit of academic excellence and fulfilment of the school motto “Pax-et-Bonum”
        
        As I hold the responsibility of this College as Principal, I appeal to all the parents to co-operate and support me in leading the college to reach the pinnacle of all glory & success.
        
        May God bless all our teaching and non teaching staff, students and parents.
