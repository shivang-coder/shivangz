    <body>“We will Answer”

        Tho’ no bugles may blow and no drums beat,
        Tho’ we hear not the marching of proud feet,
        Tho’ no flags and no pennons the day greet,
        We will answer when Duty shall call.
        
        Refrain :
        To the end we’ll be true; we’ll forget not,
        All the care Alma Mater thou spared not,
        To the spirit of Francis we’ll fail not,
        We will answer when Duty Shall call.
        
        Through the heat of the day and the burden,
        And thro’ sweat and thro’ toil without guerdon,
        To dishonour we shall not be lured in;
        We will answer when Duty shall call.
        
        With a heart and a will where the right be,
        Aitho’ arduous the task there or light be,
        We’ll be found in the thick where the fight be,
        We will answer when Duty shall call,
