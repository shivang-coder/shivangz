    <body><p><br>“Make me a channel of your peace”<br>
      <br>  Make me a channel of your peace,<br>
      <br>  Where there is hatred, let me bring your love,<br>
      <br> Where there is injury, your pardon, Lord,<br>
      <br> And where there’s doubt, true faith in you.<br>
        
      <br> Oh, Master, grant that I may never seek<br>
      <br>  So much to be consoled as to console,<br>
      <br> To be understood as to understand,<br>
      <br> To be loved as to love with all my soul.<br>
        
      <br> Make me a channel of your peace,<br>
      <br> Where there’s despair in life, let me bring hope,<br>
      <br> Where there is darkness, only light,<br>
      <br>  And where there’s sadness, ever joy.<br>
        
      <br>  Make me a channel of your peace,<br>
      <br> It is in pardoning that we are pardoned,<br>
        <br>  In giving to each one that we receive,<br>
        <br> And in dying that we’re born to eternal life</p><br></body>
